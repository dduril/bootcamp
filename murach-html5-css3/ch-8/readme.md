## HTML5 and CSS3

### Responsive Web Design

**About these pages:** *Notes and code samples from **[Murach's HTML5 and CSS3, 3rd Edition](https://www.murach.com/shop/murachs-html5-and-css3-3rd-edition-detail)**. I have been working through this text and compiling what I feel are the key points and examples from each chapter. I would highly recommend the Murach books, they have an interesting approach (content on the left page, examples on the right page) and provide solid foundations for a wide range of programming and database topics.*
