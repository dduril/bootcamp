# Bootcamp

Having upgraded to a Premium LinkedIn account, I now have access to the Lynda.com library of courses. These courses are very well produced and cover a wide spectrum of topics including project management, software programming, data analysis, and web development (both front end and full stack).

This repo is based on the 'Essentials' series and serves as a bootcamp for building a collection of code samples for a variety of popular programming languages.
