# Bootcamp

Having upgraded to a Premium LinkedIn account, I now have access to the Lynda.com library of courses. These courses are very well produced and cover a wide spectrum of topics including programming and web development.

This repo is based on the 'Essentials' series and serves as a bootcamp for building a collection of code samples for a variety of popular programming languages.
