**About these pages:** *Notes and code samples from Murach's JavaScript and jQuery, 3rd Edition. I have been working through this text and compiling what I feel are the key points and examples from each chapter. I would highly recommend the Murach books, they have a interesting approach and provide a solid foundation on a wide range of programming and database topics.*
