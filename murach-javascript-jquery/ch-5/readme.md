## JavaScript and jQuery 

### JavaScript Testing and Debugging

**About these pages:** *Notes and code samples from **[Murach's JavaScript and jQuery, 3rd Edition](https://www.murach.com/shop-books/web-development-books/murach-s-javascript-and-jquery-3rd-edition-detail)**. I have been working through this text and compiling what I feel are the key points and examples from each chapter. I would highly recommend the Murach books, they have an interesting approach (content on the left page, examples on the right page) and provide solid foundations for a wide range of programming and database topics.* 

**Types of Errors**

- *Syntax errors* - JavaScript statements that have incorrectly coded.
- *Runtime errors* - occur after the page is loaded and the application is running.
- *Logic errors* - do not cause syntax or runtime errors, but do cause the wrong results. 

**Common Syntax Errors**

- Misspelling keywords
- Leaving off required parenthesis, quotation marks, or braces
- Using different opening and closing quotation marks
- Leaving off the semicolon at the end of a statement
- Misspelling or incorrectly capitalizing variable names

**Debugging Tools**

- Firefox Firebug plugin

**Debugging Techniques**
