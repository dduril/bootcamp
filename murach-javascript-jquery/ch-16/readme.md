## JavaScript and jQuery 

### Arrays

**About these pages:** *Notes and code samples from **[Murach's JavaScript and jQuery, 3rd Edition](https://www.murach.com/shop-books/web-development-books/murach-s-javascript-and-jquery-3rd-edition-detail)**. I have been working through this text and compiling what I feel are the key points and examples from each chapter. I would highly recommend the Murach books, they have an interesting approach (content on the left page, examples on the right page) and provide solid foundations for a wide range of programming and database topics.* 

**Create an array**

    var product_codes = new Array(8, 15, 23, 34, 45);
    var departments = ["Accounting", "Human Resources", "Engineering"];
    
    var rates = new Array[4];
    rates[0] = 12.95;
    rates[1] = 18.35;
    rates[2] = 23.45;
    rates[3] = 30.15;
    
    var languages = [];
    names[0] = "HTML";
    names[1] = "CSS";
    names[2] = "JavaScript";
    names[3] = "jQuery";
