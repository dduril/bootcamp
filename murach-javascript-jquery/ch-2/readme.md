## JavaScript and jQuery 

### Getting Started with JavaScript

**About these pages:** *Notes and code samples from **[Murach's JavaScript and jQuery, 3rd Edition](https://www.murach.com/shop-books/web-development-books/murach-s-javascript-and-jquery-3rd-edition-detail)**. I have been working through this text and compiling what I feel are the key points and examples from each chapter. I would highly recommend the Murach books, they have an interesting approach (content on the left page, examples on the right page) and provide solid foundations for a wide range of programming and database topics.*
